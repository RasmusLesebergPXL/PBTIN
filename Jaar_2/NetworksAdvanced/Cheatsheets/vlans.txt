Configure Simple VLAN
=============================

	conf t
	vlan 10
	name Faculty/Staff
	
	
Configure SVI
============================

	int vlan 99
	ip address 192.168.99.252 255.255.255.0
	no shutdown
	

Assign Ports
=============================

	int fa0/11
	switchport mode access
	switchport access vlan 10
	
	
Configure Trunking
=============================

	int range g0/1-2
	switchport mode trunk
	switchport trunk allowed vlan 3,4,7 (alle vlans)
	switchport trunk native vlan 99
	

Configure DTP
=============================

"In this step, you will change the trunking mode to dynamic desirable for the link between switches S1 and S2. The link between switches S1 and S3 will be set as a static trunk"

	S1 -> S2: 
	int g0/1
	switchport mode dynamic desirable
	
	S1 -> S3:
	int g0/2
	switchport mode trunk
	switchport nonegotiate
	show dtp


Configure Port Channel
============================

	int range f0/23-24
	shutdown
	channel-group 3 mode ? (passive/active/desirable/auto)
	no sh
	int port-channel 3
	switchport mode trunk
	
"Port Channel 2 is not operative because Spanning Tree Protocol placed some ports into blocking mode. Unfortunately, those ports were the Gigabit ports. In this topology, you can restore these ports by configuring S1 to be primary root for VLAN 1. You could also set the priority to 24576."

	spanning-tree vlan 1 root primary
	


Configure IP(v6) Routing + SVI
=============================
	
	ip routing
	*ipv6 unicast-routing
	int vlan 10
	ipv6 address 2001:db8:acad:10::1/64

	
	
	
VoIP config
=============================

"The S3 F0/11 interface must be configured to support user traffic to PC4 using VLAN 10 and voice traffic to the IP phone using VLAN 150. The interface must also enable QoS and trust the Class of Service (CoS) values assigned by the IP phone. IP voice traffic requires a minimum amount of throughput to support acceptable voice communication quality. This command helps the switchport to provide this minimum amount of throughput."

	int fa0/11
	mls qos trust cos
	switchport voice vlan 150
